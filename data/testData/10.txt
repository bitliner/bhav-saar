'Major' Microsoft announcement
LOS ANGELES — Microsoft is expected to make a "major" announcement Monday. Speculation about the Los Angeles media event is that the company plans to unveil either a tablet computer or a system that uses an upcoming version of Windows to help people access TV shows and movies across a range of devices.Microsoft Corp.'s next operating system, Windows 8, is designed to run desktop, laptop and tablet computers, giving PC makers a better chance to compete with Apple Inc.'s iPad. Windows 8 is expected to be released in September or October, in time for devices that ship for the holiday season.The event, set to start at 3:30 p.m. Pacific time, is being kept under such tight wraps that the company has declined to provide its location until Monday.
