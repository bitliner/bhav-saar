Just what is Windows RT, anyway? (FAQ)
What in the world is Windows RT? Coming off of our previous coverage, you may have heard about Windows 8 and Windows RT as being different. While Microsoft has made a point of cutting down on the number of Windows 8 versions available when compared with previous Windows releases, the company is also making a limited Windows 8 version to run on ARM processors called Windows RT. What does "RT" stand for? As with Windows NT, Microsoft has yet to clarify what "RT" actually means. Why on Earth Microsoft decided to name the ARM-powered version of Windows so ridiculously similar to the abbreviation for Windows Runtime, WinRT, is beyond the abilities of mere mortals to decipher. Wait, what? Windows RT and WinRT aren't the same thing? The short answer is, "Nope." The long answer is, well, longer. Windows Runtime, also referred to as WinRT, runs on both standard Windows 8 and Windows RT. Runtime is the technical term for the engine that powers the new Metro apps. It's not the first Windows Runtime. "Runtime" refers to the collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to write software that can interact with the hardware and each other. Windows RT is simply a name that Microsoft has given to Windows 8 on ARM. You wouldn't be entirely off base to think of it as "Windows Lite," given its restrictions and differences from standard Windows 8, which runs both Metro and Desktop modes. What is Metro? Metro is the new user interface for Windows 8. Instead of icons, there are "tiles" that can surface information from the app in real-time, and it's powered by WinRT. So, what is WinRT? Basically, WinRT is the underpinnings of the Metro side of Windows 8. But it does more than implement the Metro interface, it also simplifies much of the programming for Windows developers. Coding for Metro is significantly easier than writing a program for Windows 7 and earlier. This is important for Microsoft because it can now point to Windows 8 as an attractive place for developers to ply their trade. What's the difference between Windows 8 and Windows RT? There are several notable differences, and they could cause Windows RT to fail while Windows 8 succeeds. Microsoft has produced a chart of the differences between Windows 8 and Window RT, but here are the highlights: Windows RT will work only on ARM-powered devices Windows RT will have a Desktop mode, but it will be restricted to pre-installed, Microsoft-produced software. This will include touch-optimized versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote Windows RT will come with device encryption Neither old nor new x86/x64 programs will work on Windows RT What kind of apps can Windows RT run? The focus of Metro apps will be on Internet connectivity, cloud synchronization, and responsiveness. If it works in Windows 8 Metro, it will work on Windows RT. Will I be able to update an old ARM-powered device with Windows RT? No. At this point, Windows RT will be available only pre-installed. That's not expected to change, either. What's the benefit of ARM? ARM processors power virtually all iOS, Android, and other mobile devices on the market. ARM has gained so much traction in large part because of its better battery management. Are there any other drawbacks to Windows RT? There are a couple that stand out so far that we haven't mentioned yet. There are certain core APIs that Microsoft is restricting access to in Windows RT that are available in full Windows 8. This has caused much consternation among browser vendors and has raised fears that Microsoft is attempting to cut off browser innovation by locking down Windows RT the way Apple has locked down iOS. The OEM license for Windows RT is expected to be in the $80 range, so it's likely that Windows RT devices will be notably more expensive than their Android-powered counterparts. While we've seen some hardware specs for standard Windows 8 devices, including tablets, we haven't seen any confirmed specs for a single Windows RT tablet. That doesn't bode well for manufacturer confidence. There doesn't seem to be a way to visually distinguish a Windows RT tablet from a Windows 8 tablet, which could lead to buyer confusion, to put it mildly. Windows RT remains the biggest gamble that Microsoft is taking with Windows 8, because it's cutting itself off from legacy Windows. Sure, there's a free version of Office included, and that may draw some people in on its own. There's scant evidence from consumers or manufacturers that they're interested in this version of Windows 8, but it could also position Microsoft for future growth in a way that limiting itself to Intel chips can't. Correction, Friday at 11:50 p.m. PDT: The original version of this FAQ conflated the terms "Windows RT" and "WinRT." They have since been clarified.
